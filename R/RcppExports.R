#'@title Encode or decode a URI
#'@description encodes or decodes a URI/URL
#'
#'@param urls a vector of URLs to decode or encode.
#'
#'@details
#'URL encoding and decoding is an essential prerequisite to proper web interaction
#'and data analysis around things like server-side logs. The
#'\href{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986}{relevant IETF RfC} mandates the percentage-encoding
#'of non-Latin characters, including things like slashes, unless those are reserved.
#'
#'Base R provides \code{\link{URLdecode}} and \code{\link{URLencode}}, which handle
#'URL encoding - in theory. In practise, they have a set of substantial problems
#'that the urltools implementation solves::
#'
#'\itemize{
#' \item{No vectorisation: }{Both base R functions operate on single URLs, not vectors of URLs.
#'       This means that, when confronted with a vector of URLs that need encoding or
#'       decoding, your only option is to loop from within R. This can be incredibly
#'       computationally costly with large datasets. url_encode and url_decode are
#'       implemented in C++ and entirely vectorised, allowing for a substantial
#'       performance improvement.}
#' \item{No scheme recognition: }{encoding the slashes in, say, http://, is a good way
#'       of making sure your URL no longer works. Because of this, the only thing
#'       you can encode in URLencode (unless you refuse to encode reserved characters)
#'       is a partial URL, lacking the initial scheme, which requires additional operations
#'       to set up and increases the complexity of encoding or decoding. url_encode
#'       detects the protocol and silently splits it off, leaving it unencoded to ensure
#'       that the resulting URL is valid.}
#' \item{ASCII NULs: }{Server side data can get very messy and sometimes include out-of-range
#'       characters. Unfortunately, URLdecode's response to these characters is to convert
#'       them to NULs, which R can't handle, at which point your URLdecode call breaks.
#'       \code{url_decode} simply ignores them.}
#'}
#'
#'@return a character vector containing the encoded (or decoded) versions of "urls".

#'@title split URLs into their component parts
#'@description \code{url_parse} takes a vector of URLs and splits each one into its component
#'parts, as recognised by RfC 3986.
#'
#'@param urls a vector of URLs
#'
#'@param normalise whether to normalise the URLs - essentially, whether or not to
#'make them consistently lower-case. Set to TRUE by default.
#'
#'@details It's useful to be able to take a URL and split it out into its component parts - 
#'for the purpose of hostname extraction, for example, or analysing API calls. This functionality
#'is not provided in base R, although it is provided in \code{\link[httr]{parse_url}}; that
#'implementation is entirely in R, uses regular expressions, and is not vectorised. It's
#'perfectly suitable for the intended purpose (decomposition in the context of automated
#'HTTP requests from R), but not for large-scale analysis.
#'
#'@return a list of vectors, one for each URL, with each vector containing (in sequence)
#'the URL's scheme, domain, port, path, query string and fragment identifier. See the
#'\href{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986}{relevant IETF RfC} for definitions. If an element
#'cannot be identified, it is replaced with an empty string.
