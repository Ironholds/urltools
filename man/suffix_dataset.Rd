\title{Dataset of public suffixes}
\format{
A data.frame of 8030 rows and 2 columns
}
\usage{
data(suffix_dataset)
}
\description{
This dataset contains a registry of public suffixes, as retrieved from
and defined by the \href{https://publicsuffix.org/}{public suffix list}. It is
sorted by how many periods(".") appear in the suffix, to optimise it for
\code{\link{suffix_extract}}.  It is a data.frame with two columns, the first is
the list of suffixes and the second is our best guess at the comment or owner 
associated with the particular suffix.
